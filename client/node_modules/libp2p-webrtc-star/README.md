> libp2p WebRTC transport that includes a discovery mechanism provided by the signalling-star

## Description

`libp2p-webrtc-star` is one of the WebRTC transports available for libp2p. `libp2p-webrtc-star incorporates both a transport and a discovery service that is facilitated by the signalling server, also part of this module.

**Note:** This module uses [pull-streams](https://pull-stream.github.io) for all stream based interfaces.

## Example

```JavaScript
TODO
```

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
> npm install libp2p-webrtc-star
```

### API

### Signalling server

`libp2p-webrtc-star` comes with its own signalling server, used for peers to handshake their signalling data and establish a connection. You can install it in your machine by installing the module globally:

```bash
> npm install --global libp2p-webrtc-star
```

This will expose a `star-sig` cli tool. To spawn a server do:

```bash
> star-signal --port=9090 --host=127.0.0.1
```

Defaults:

- `port` - 13579
- `host` - '0.0.0.0'

## Hosted Signalling Server

We host a signalling server at `star-signal.cloud.ipfs.team` that can be used for practical demos and experimentation, it **should not be used for apps in production**.
A libp2p-webrtc-star address, using the signalling server we provide, looks like: 

`/libp2p-webrtc-star/dns4/star-signal.cloud.ipfs.team/wss/ipfs/<your-peer-id>`

Note: The address above indicates WebSockets Secure, which can be accessed from both http and https.

### This module uses `pull-streams`

We expose a streaming interface based on `pull-streams`, rather then on the Node.js core streams implementation (aka Node.js streams). `pull-streams` offers us a better mechanism for error handling and flow control guarantees. If you would like to know more about why we did this, see the discussion at this [issue](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/362).

- [pull-streams documentation](https://pull-stream.github.io/)

#### Converting `pull-streams` to Node.js Streams

If you are a Node.js streams user, you can convert a pull-stream to a Node.js stream using the module [`pull-stream-to-stream`](https://github.com/pull-stream/pull-stream-to-stream), giving you an instance of a Node.js stream that is linked to the pull-stream. For example:

```JavaScript
const pullToStream = require('pull-stream-to-stream')

const nodeStreamInstance = pullToStream(pullStreamInstance)
// nodeStreamInstance is an instance of a Node.js Stream
```
